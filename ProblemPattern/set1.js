//Que: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//implement addition
// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
//ints
//floats
//what abt strings for large numbers

// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
//ints
//floats

// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
